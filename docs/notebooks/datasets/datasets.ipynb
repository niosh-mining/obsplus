    "# Datasets\n",
    "Obsplus includes a few interesting datasets, and we hope to add more in the future. The datasets are \"lazy\" in that all but the most essential information will be downloaded only when some code asks for the dataset. This helps keep the size of obsplus small, but does mean you will need an internet connection the first time you use each dataset. Here are the datasets we have so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Kemmerer:\n",
    "    A few days of continuous data recorded by TA stations M17A and M18A back in 2009 near Kemmerer Wyoming (USA). The stations recorded several nearby mine blasts, and I used these stations in [my MS thesis](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-abstract/203/2/1388/584019) (shameless plug). This data set provides continuous waveform data for two stations, a catalog of mining blasts, and an inventory. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. TA:\n",
    "    A small dataset with two stations from the TA with channels that have very low sampling rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Crandall:\n",
    "    Event waveforms for the [Crandall Canyon Mine collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crandall_Canyon_Mine) and associated aftershocks. This dataset includes only event waveforms, but it has them for many TA and UUSS stations. It also includes a catalog of the events and a station inventory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Bingham:\n",
    "    Event waveforms associated with the [Bingham Canyon Landslide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_Canyon_Mine#Landslides), one of the largest anthropogenic landslides ever recorded. Luckily, the situation was well managed and no one was hurt. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Each of these data sets is accessed via `obsplus.load_dataset` function which takes the name of the dataset as the only argument. It then returns a `DataSet` instance. This will take a few minutes if the datasets have not yet been downloaded, otherwise it should be very quick."
