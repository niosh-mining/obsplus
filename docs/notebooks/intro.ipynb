    "*\"A Pandas-Centric ObsPy Expansion Pack\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "ObsPlus is python (3.6+) package that adds functionality to the excellent seismology package [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki). \n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Unifying Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "ObsPlus enables sharing data retrieval interfaces for each kind of seismic data (events, waveforms, and stations) regardless of scale of the source. This is made possible by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [WaveBank](./interfaces/wavebank.ipynb) for working with local archives of waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [EventBank](./interfaces/eventbank.ipynb) for working with local archives of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Added obspy methods](./interfaces/obspy_methods.ipynb) for treating `Stream`, `Catalog` and `Inventory` instances the same as remote clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Fetcher](./interfaces/fetcher.ipynb) for dataset-aware data retrieval through composing waveform, events, and station clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Alternative Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Obsplus provides several conversion functions to transform normal obspy data structures into [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) or [DataArrays](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.html). These can be more convenient/efficient to work with, but come with their own trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Summarize event data](./datastructures/events_to_pandas.ipynb) as pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Summarize station data](./datastructures/stations_to_pandas.ipynb) as pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Convert wavefroms to xarray DataArrays](./datastructures/xarray.ipynb) for efficient array processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Some utilities that you don't have to rewrite yourself. Some of these will be moved to obspy if their usefulness to a wider audience is established.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Catalog validation](./utils/catalog_validation.ipynb) to bring a little more sanity to an already chaotic world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [DataFrameExtractor](./utils/dataframeextractor.ipynb) to develop your own dataframe converters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Catalog to json](./utils/json.ipynb) to, well, convert catalogs to json. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Miscellaneous utilities](./utils/misc.ipynb) for a grab-bag of goodies. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## 4. Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Often seismology codes benefit from a complete set of station, event, and waveform data for testing and demonstration. Obsplus provides a few interesting (at least to the authors) datasets. Moreover, In only a few minutes, you can make your own research datasets pip installable using the [dataset template](https://github.com/seismopy/opsdata).\n",
    " \n",
    "- [A tour of obsplus datasets](./datasets/datasets.ipynb), used for testing and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To search pypi for obsplus datasets registered by other users you can use pip like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip search opsdata*\n",
    "```"
