    "`WaveBank` is an in-process database for accessing seismic time-series data. Any directory structure containing obspy-readable waveforms can be used as the data source. `WaveBank` uses a simple indexing scheme and the [Hierarchical Data Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) to keep track of each `Trace` in the directory.\n",

    "In this tutorial after downloading seismic data with [obspy's fdsn mass download](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.fdsn.mass_downloader.html), `WaveBank` will provide a way to access the data. The alternative is to manually navigate directories of waveform files and to load the desired data but this can become very tedious and clutters up your application code with data access code. `WaveBank` provides a better way.
