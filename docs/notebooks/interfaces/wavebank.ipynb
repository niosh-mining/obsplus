    "`WaveBank` is an in-process database for accessing seismic time-series data. Any directory structure containing ObsPy-readable waveforms can be used as the data source. `WaveBank` uses a simple indexing scheme and the [Hierarchical Data Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) to keep track of each `Trace` in the directory. Without `WaveBank` (or another similar program) applications have implement their own data organization/access logic which is tedious and clutters up application code. `WaveBank` provides a better way. \n",
