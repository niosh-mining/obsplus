    "# Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions to ObsPlus are welcomed and appreciated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few details you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to setup ObsPlus for development you need to 1) clone ObsPlus 2) create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) 3) install ObsPlus in development mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), the following commands should do the trick:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/niosh-mining/obsplus\n",
    "conda create -n obsplus_dev obspy pandas\n",
    "conda activate obsplus\n",
    "cd obsplus\n",
    "pip install -e .[dev]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this [git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). **Bug fixes should be based on the branch named \"master\" and new features should be based on the branch named \"develop\"**. Master will be merged into develop (when needed) and a release will merge develop into master.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ObsPlus uses [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) and [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for code linting. Before you make any commits please run black and flake8 on your branch like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "black .\n",
    "flake8 .\n",
    "```\n",
    "Address any issues raised by flake8 then commit your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use [numpy style docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). All public code (doesn't start with a _) should have a \"full\" docstring but private code (starts with a _) can have an abbreviated docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ObsPlus makes extensive use of Python 3's [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). You are encouraged to annotate any public functions/methods with type hints. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefer `pathlib.Path` to strings when working with paths. However, when dealing with millions of files (eg ObsPlus' indexers) strings may be preferred for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have cleared all output of any notebooks before making a commit. This can be done with the script `clean_docs.py` found in the scripts folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow [PEP8's guidelines for imports](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# example public function\n",
    "def example_func(df: pd.DataFrame, to_add: Optional[Union[int, float]]) -> pd.DataFrame:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    A simple, one line explanation of what this code does.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Additional details which might be useful, and are not limited to one line.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parameters\n",
    "    ----------\n",
    "    df\n",
    "        A description of this parameter\n",
    "    to_add\n",
    "        A description of this parameter\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Returns\n",
    "    -------\n",
    "    If needed, more information about what this function returns.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    out = df.copy()\n",
    "    if to_add is not None:\n",
    "        out = out + to_add\n",
    "    return out\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# example private function\n",
    "def _recombobulate(df, arg1, arg2):\n",
    "    \"\"\" \n",
    "    A private function can have a simple (multi-line) snippet and doesn't need as \n",
    "    much detail or type hinting as a public function.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "Column names should be snake_cased whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Always access columns with getitem and not getattr (ie use `df['column_name']` not `df.column_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefer creating new `DataFrame`s/`Series` to modifying them inplace. Inplace modifications should require opting in (perhaps through an `inplace` key word argument).\n"
