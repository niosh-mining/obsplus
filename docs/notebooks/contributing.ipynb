    "# Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions to ObsPlus are welcomed and appreciated. Before proceeding please be aware of our [code of conduct](https://github.com/niosh-mining/obsplus/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few details you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are needed to setup `ObsPlus` for development:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Clone ObsPlus\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/niosh-mining/obsplus \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Pull tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you pull all the latest git tags (especially if some time has passed since you cloned ObsPlus) so that the dynamic versioning provided by [versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer) works.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull origin master --tags\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Create a virtual environment (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create and activate a virtual environment so ObsPlus wont mess with your base (or system) python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n obsplus_dev obspy pandas pre-commit \n",
    "conda activate obsplus_dev\n",
    "cd obsplus\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Install ObsPlus in development mode\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .[dev]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Setup precommit hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "ObsPlus uses several [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to ensure the code stays tidy. These should be simple to install like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pre-commit install -f\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Branching and versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "We just create new features or bug fixes in their own branches then merge them into master via pull requests. We may switch to a more complex branching model if the need arises but for now we are just keeping things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "If substantial new features have been added since the last release we will bump the minor version, if only bug fixes/minor changes have been made we bump the patch version. Like most python projects, we only loosely follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in that we won't bump the major version until ObsPlus is very stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests suite is run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). Simply make sure your current directory is set to the cloned ObsPlus repo, that you have followed the development setup instructions listed above, and invoke pytest from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest tests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation can be built using the script called \"make_docs.py\" in the scripts directory. As long as you followed the instructions above all the required dependencies should be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python scripts/make_docs.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then access the docs by double clicking on the newly created html index at docs/_build/html/index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ObsPlus uses [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) and [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for code linting. If you have properly installed ObsPlus' pre-commit hooks these will be invoked automatically when you make a git commit. If any complaints are raised simply address them and try again. Don't worry it happens to everyone ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use [numpy style docstrings](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/docs/howto_document.html). All public code (doesn't start with a _) should have a \"full\" docstring but private code (starts with a _) can have an abbreviated docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ObsPlus makes extensive use of Python 3's [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). You are encouraged to annotate any public functions/methods with type hints. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefer `pathlib.Path` to strings when working with paths. However, when dealing with millions of files (eg ObsPlus' indexers) strings may be preferred for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow [PEP8's guidelines for imports](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example functions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import Optional, Union\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",

    "# example public function\n",
    "def example_func(df: pd.DataFrame, to_add: Optional[Union[int, float]]) -> pd.DataFrame:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    A simple, one line explanation of what this function does.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Additional details which might be useful, and are not limited to one line.\n",
    "    In fact, they might span several lines, especially if the author of the\n",
    "    docstring tends to include more details than needed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parameters\n",
    "    ----------\n",
    "    df\n",
    "        A description of this parameter\n",
    "    to_add\n",
    "        A description of this parameter\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Returns\n",
    "    -------\n",
    "    If needed, more information about what this function returns. You shouldn't\n",
    "    simply specify the type here since that is already given by the type annotation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Examples\n",
    "    --------\n",
    "    >>> # Examples are included in the doctest style\n",
    "    >>> import numpy as np\n",
    "    >>> import pandas as pd\n",
    "    >>> \n",
    "    >>> df = pd.DataFrame(np.random(10))\n",
    "    >>> out = example_func(df)  \n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    out = df.copy()\n",
    "    if to_add is not None:\n",
    "        out = out + to_add\n",
    "    return out\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# example private function\n",
    "def _recombobulate(df, arg1, arg2):\n",
    "    \"\"\" \n",
    "    A private function can have a simple (multi-line) snippet and doesn't need as \n",
    "    much detail or type hinting as a public function.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "Column names should be snake_cased whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Always access columns with getitem and not getattr (ie use `df['column_name']` not `df.column_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefer creating a new `DataFrame`/`Series` to modifying them inplace. Inplace modifications should require opting in (usually through an `inplace` key word argument).\n"
